I've discovered a bug in my cat vs mouse game's logic.

**Problem:** The cat and mouse agents can sometimes occupy the same grid cell or cross paths, but the game does not register a win for the cat.

**Desired Behavior:** The cat's victory condition should be a direct collision. The game should end, and the cat should be declared the winner, as soon as the cat's position on the grid is identical to the mouse's position.

Please analyze the game logic for agent movement and the win condition check. Provide the code to fix this issue and ensure that the cat is correctly registered as the winner upon collision.

I need to update how the vision characters are rendered and how their symbols are handled in the UI.

**Rendering Logic:** Currently, cat vision is represented by `?` and mouse vision by `!`. I want to change this so that both cat and mouse vision are represented by `?`. A new character, `!`, should now be used specifically to show when the two vision fields overlap or collide.

**UI Updates:** Please update the "Character Customization" tab to reflect these changes. Both "Cat Vision" and "Mouse Vision" should now display `?`, and a new entry should be created for "Vision Collision" with the character `!`. Additionally, please ensure the legend at the bottom of the screen is updated accordingly to explain the new character assignments.

I have an issue where the spacing of some of my UI elements appears odd and inconsistent.

**Problem:** The vertical and horizontal spacing between various controls, dropdowns, and labels in the "Settings" and "Analytics Panel" is not uniform. Elements like "TYPOGRAPHY CONTROLS," "CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION," and the main dropdown buttons themselves have irregular spacing, making the layout look cluttered.

**Desired Outcome:** Please analyze the CSS for these UI elements and adjust their margins, padding, and alignment to create a clean, consistent, and visually balanced layout throughout the control panels. The spacing between all list items and controls should be uniform.

### **UI/UX and Rendering Improvements**

- **Expandable Menus and Active Border Removal:** The "LEARNING PARAMETERS" and "DISPLAY CONTROLS" sections need to be made into closeable menus, similar to the other controls. They should function as collapsible accordion sections. Additionally, please update the CSS so that when any of these menus are in their open or active state, their border is removed.
  
  
  I need to implement a new vision system and new player controls for the agents in my game.

**Vision & Movement Logic:**

- **Cone Vision:** Please replace the agents' current 360-degree vision with a new "cone vision" mode. This limited field of view should extend in a specific direction from the agent.
    
- **Combined Action:** In a single step of an episode, an agent should now be able to perform a move and a rotation. This means they can move one step in a direction and, within the same turn, rotate their cone vision to face any other direction they want.
    
- **New Control Button:** Add a new button to the user interface called "Normal Vision Toggle." This button should switch the game's active vision mode. When toggled on, it enables the new, limited cone vision. When toggled off, it reverts the agents to their original 360-degree vision.
    

Please update the agent logic to support these new actions, implement the new vision rendering, and add  vision size in the simulation parameters for both cat and mouse  above the obstacle count

make Â· as the render grid empty space, since its in the characters setting but doesn't automatically load the render with it


- **Button State Change:** The interface has two buttons, 'Start' and 'Continue'. When a user uploads a file, the 'Start' button should change its text to 'Continue'. The original 'Continue' button should be removed from the interface. The new 'Continue' button should perform the same action as the original 'Start' button.
    
- **Upload Button Feedback:** The file upload button should provide feedback. After a successful upload, its text should change to 'Success' for 3 seconds before reverting to its original text. If the upload fails, its text should change to 'Failed' for 3 seconds and then revert.
    
- **File Detachment:** Once a file is uploaded, a small 'x' button should appear next to the file name. Clicking this 'x' should detach the file, and the UI should revert to its initial state (the 'Start' button reappears, etc.).
    
- **Remove Browser Notifications:** The default browser notification that appears when a file is attached should be suppressed to create a cleaner user experience.


learning parameter section needs to be tabbed for both cat and mouse learning parameters or make the bar half thee size and label

remove the underline for learning parameters title but still allow user to click for information

footer text animation should be set as
radius 300, duration 5 and speed 0.1
also remove the header animation and apply the same as the footer with same settings

---------------------------

even faster speed on slider
remove slider borders

al 4 settings tabs (settings, layout positioning, typography, characters) should be hidden and only shows if user presses a shortcut, i want the shortcut  to be ctrl + m

footer effect is not so fluid now. also the title header doesnt have the same effect

remove hyperlink to info page from learning parameters dropdown
________________________
remove mouse and cat direction from display controls, once started always open display controls,

we need the rewards explained in the welcome page and setup a section in control panel for rewards under learning parameters behaving like learning parameters

parameter numbers are not updating with slider in control center
