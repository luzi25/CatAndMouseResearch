A sophisticated web-based AI simulation featuring reinforcement learning agents in a predator-prey ecosystem with advanced visual effects and comprehensive customization options.

## üéØ Features

### Core Simulation
- **Q-Learning AI Agents**: Cat (predator) and Mouse (prey) with independent learning algorithms
- **Dynamic Environment**: Customizable grid size, obstacle placement, and spawn points
- **Real-time Analytics**: Performance tracking with win/loss statistics and episode data
- **Training Persistence**: Save/load training data with environment configurations

### Visual Effects
- **CRT Monitor Simulation**: Phosphor glow, scanlines, contrast, brightness, and saturation controls
- **Fisheye Lens Effect**: Dramatic lens distortion with elliptical clipping and enhanced vignette
- **Text Pressure Effects**: Dynamic character styling based on mouse proximity with weight, opacity, and scale effects
- **Scramble Text Animation**: Footer text scrambling effect for enhanced immersion

### User Interface
- **Consolidated Settings Panel**: Organized dropdown with Typography and Character customization subsections
- **Direct Character Editing**: Click-to-edit functionality for all game characters (¬∑, C, M, O, ?, !)
- **Themed Controls**: Custom sliders and styled input elements with cyan color scheme
- **Responsive Design**: Viewport-constrained interface that prevents layout overflow

### Typography System
- **Font Customization**: Individual size controls for all interface elements
- **Grid Character Control**: Adjustable character size and spacing for the game grid
- **Value Display Toggle**: Show/hide parameter value displays
- **Reset Functionality**: One-click reset to default typography settings

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Open `lumon_research.html` in a modern web browser
2. Click **"Start Training"** to begin the AI simulation
3. Use the **Settings** dropdown to customize visual effects and characters
4. Monitor agent performance in real-time through the analytics panel
5. Save training progress using the **Download Training** button

## üéÆ Controls

### Training Controls
- **Start Training**: Begin new training session
- **Stop Training**: Pause current session
- **Continue Training**: Resume paused session
- **Download/Upload**: Save and restore training data

### Visual Customization
- **CRT Effects**: Enable/disable retro monitor simulation
- **Fisheye Lens**: Adjust lens distortion intensity (0-5)
- **Text Pressure**: Mouse-proximity-based text effects
- **Character Editing**: Click any blue character value to edit

### Grid Settings
- **Font Size**: Character size in the game grid
- **Spacing**: Horizontal and vertical character spacing
- **Characters**: Customize all game symbols (empty space, cat, mouse, obstacles, vision indicators)

## üîß Technical Details

### AI Implementation
- **Q-Learning Algorithm**: Reinforcement learning with epsilon-greedy exploration
- **State Space**: Grid position awareness with obstacle detection
- **Action Space**: 5 actions (up, down, left, right, stay)
- **Reward System**: Distance-based rewards with win/loss bonuses

### Performance Features
- **Optimized Rendering**: Efficient DOM updates for smooth animation
- **Memory Management**: Persistent Q-tables with training data compression
- **Responsive UI**: Viewport-constrained layouts preventing scroll overflow

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers with ES6+ support

- Minimum viewport: 1024x768 for optimal experience

## üìä Analytics

The simulation provides comprehensive performance metrics:
- **Episode Tracking**: Current episode number and step count
- **Win Statistics**: Cat vs Mouse victory counts
- **Performance Charts**: Visual representation of training progress
- **Training Data**: Exportable session data with environment configuration

## üé® Customization

### Character Set
- Empty Space: `¬∑` (middle dot)
- Cat (Predator): `C`
- Mouse (Prey): `M`
- Obstacles: `O`
- Cat Vision: `?`
