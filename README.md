## ü§ñ AI Behavior

### Cat (Predator) Strategy
- **Individual Learning**: Customizable learning rate and exploration parameters with optimized reward system
- **Aggressive Hunting**: Enhanced reward system (+8 for hunting, +2 for exploration) encourages persistent pursuit
- **Dynamic Hunting**: Rotates vision cone toward mouse for strategic pursuit each step
- **Vision-Based Pursuit**: Utilizes directional cone vision for focused tracking with strategic penalties for retreating
- **Adaptive Behavior**: Balances exploration vs exploitation with separate epsilon decay and movement pressure (-0.1 for standing still)

### Mouse (Prey) Strategy
- **Separate AI System**: Independent learning parameters from cat agent with balanced reward constraints
- **Strategic Escape**: Rebalanced reward system (+4 for strategic escape, +2 for blind escape) requires more tactical thinking
- **Evasion Tactics**: Dynamically rotates between watching cat and looking away (30% evasion chance) with movement pressure (-0.2 for standing still)
- **Danger Awareness**: Enhanced penalty system (-0.5/-2) for approaching threats encourages smarter positioning
- **Survival Optimization**: Learns optimal movement and rotation patterns with risk/reward balance for competitive gameplay
